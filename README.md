Team Building Teams of hackers win more often than individual hackers. Collaborating with other participants will help you come up with more creative ideas and accomplish more during the short time you have to code.

Already you should be starting to think about what you're going to build and who's going to be on your team. You can and should build any hack you want. We find that the best hacks solve problems that you yourself experience – i.e. scratch your own itch. The only limitation is that all coding must be done during the 24-hour hack period, not before the event.

Please use the Join-A-Team page to start posting ideas, sharing your technical strengths and forming teams.

Hardware Workshops We have some brilliant Hardware Workshops available for hackers. At the beginner workshop for Arduino, learn to make interactive wearable electronics with LEDs and sensors using lilypad kit. Or, learn to hack the 6 Nodecopters we'll have available at the event. The Arduino workshop is limited to 19 groups and the Nodecopters workshop is limited to 6 teams. Register here.
